1. implement mutex optimized for rare EXCLUSIVE and frequent SHARED lockin: DONE
2. simplify virtual volume implementation with boost::multi_index_container
3. using shared mutex in MRU cache is terrible idea, cuz every access to MRU cache implies writting, but upgrade from SHARED to EXCUSIVE lock is extremely hard operation
